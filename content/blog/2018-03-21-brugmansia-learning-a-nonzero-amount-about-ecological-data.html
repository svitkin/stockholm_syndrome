<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This post is inspired by the imbalance of my interest in the field of ecology and my understanding of it. Because I have some knowledge of statistics and programming (the work I do is occasionally referred to as “data science” by people less resentful than me), I thought I would do some simplistic data stuff! I’m going to assume anyone reading this has as much knowledge of ecology as I do (i.e. they read a book about it years ago that they liked very much).</p>

<h2>Brugmansia</h2>
<p>I chose to focus on the plant genus (the step above species in taxonomic rank) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brugmansia">Brugmansia</a> for my exploration. It has a really interesting and complicated history worth checking out!</p>

<h2>Obtaining Data</h2>
<p><strong>Insert information about BIEN</strong></p>
